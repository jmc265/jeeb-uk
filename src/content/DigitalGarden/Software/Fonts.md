I am currently using the [Fira Code font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for software development as it adds extra ligatures to the font to make reading common programming symbols a lot easier. 

As a backup, I would suggest the [Hack font](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack).

However, instead of using these 2 fonts directly, I would recommend using the ["Nerd" versions](https://www.nerdfonts.com) of them as it adds a bunch of icons into the fonts for use in terminals.

There is also the [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git) repo which has a bunch of common fonts patched with the icons used in terminals.
