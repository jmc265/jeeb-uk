As a Software Engineer, I spend a fair amount of my time in a Terminal. Especially when dealing with my [Self Hosting setup](Digital%20Garden%20ðŸŒ³/Self%20Hosting/Index.md Hosting/Index.md>). Therefore, it makes sense to spend some time to make the experience as pleasant as possible.

My setup for all my terminals is shown in [github.com/jmc265/dotfiles](https://github.com/jmc265/dotfiles), but I have listed my current setup below:

- **Shell:** [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) - More because it allows for the powerful customisations listed below
- **Shell Helper:** [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) - For easier customisation of the terminal
- **Shell Theme:** [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - Awesome theme for ZSH
- ZSH Plugins: 
	- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
	- [web search](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/web-search)
	- history
	- git
	- docker
	- docker-compose
	- npm 
	- yarn
	- vscode
	- terraform
- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) - Just to have something pretty in the login MotD
