## What?
This is a collection of knowledge gained from reading and experience. Across the web, these types of sites are called Personal Wikis or "Digital Gardens".
The topics in my Digital Garden include:
- [Software Engineering](Digital%20Garden%20ðŸŒ³/Software%20Engineering/Index.md Engineering/Index.md>)/[Programming](Digital%20Garden/Programming/Index.md)
- [Cloud & Web](Digital%20Garden%20ðŸŒ³/Cloud%20&%20Web/Index.md & Web/Index.md>)/[System Design](Digital%20Garden/Design/Index.md)
- [Self Hosting](Digital%20Garden%20ðŸŒ³/Self%20Hosting/Index.md Hosting/Index.md>)/[Smart Home](Digital%20Garden%20ðŸŒ³/Smart%20Home/Index.md Home/Index.md>)
- [3D Printing](Digital%20Garden%20ðŸŒ³/3D%20Printing/Index.md Printing/Index.md>)/[Drones](Digital%20Garden/Drones/Index.md)/Anything else that interests me

## Why?
Retaining complex in-depth knowledge for instant recall is hard (and generally unnecessary). It is much easier to merge a new piece of information into your mental model and move on. But that means that original source of the information will be lost. These notes are an attempt at putting that mental model down on to (digital) paper as well as a way to preserve the original information that shaped the model.

## Who?
These notes are primarily meant for:
- Future me. To help me organise my thoughts and to search through past sources
- Colleagues/Friends etc. To share a curated list of links/resources I feel are worthwhile 

## How?
The notes are all Markdown files (edited in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) which are then rendered out to HTML using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
