### Hi, I am James. 

I'm a seasoned Staff Software Engineer with 23 years of experience in the world of code. I enjoy tackling complex tech challenges and guiding dynamic teams to success. I have a particular fondness for frontend applications because I appreciate the user-focused aspect. Beyond code, I'm dedicated to fostering innovation and leading my team to achieve their best. 

## Employment 

I am currently working on the **Marks & Spencer** website, leading a team of engineers in the ground-up replatforming of all pages onto Next.js. 

Previously I have worked in the **finance industry**, at Deutsche Bank, Thomson Reuters and Morgan Stanley.
