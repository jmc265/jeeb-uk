I have started down a thought experiment, comparing "AI" systems to physical engines like the internal combustion engine in cars, fusion/fission reactors, and eventually to perpetual motion machines.

Envisioning ai models as an energy machine. It takes a large amount external energy to start it up (manual training data created by humans) but to expect it to ignite and continue producing better results without external energy input is the same as thinking perpetual energy machines will work.
