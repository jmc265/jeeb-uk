Domain Name Squatters are a particular type of villain. They can sit on a domain which costs them ~£5 p/y in the hopes of selling it for £1000's. They could feasibly own the domain for **hundreds** of years and still make a profit. It would be amazing if yearly prices could double for each year the domain owner doesn't put actual content on a domain.... rant over... now off to find a sucky domain name that I can put up with.
