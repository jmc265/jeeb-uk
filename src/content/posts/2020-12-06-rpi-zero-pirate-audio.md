As a gift, I received a [Raspberry Pi Zero Pirate Audio](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-audio-line-out)Mini HAT. I got it all set up with [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/) but I wanted to have it displayed nicely on my desk so that I could easily glance over and see the current song/artists, as well as easily access the next/previous buttons.

Luckily, someone on Thingiverse had already created a flat case for the [Rpi Zero with the Pirate Audio HAT attached](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4087948). I have added to the design to create a 45 degree built in stand. The only complex part of this is that the Rpi is now used up-side-down because the power cable needed to come out of the top for clearance. There are settings on the built-in display to allow for a 180 degree rotation.
