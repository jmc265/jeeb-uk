Today, I walked around London Bridge area, and attempted a style of photography I haven't tried before: street photography.

It feels a little weird to me, to be taking photos in such a busy place, and of subjects who don't necessarily know they are part of the photo. The photos I have shown here do not feature anyone who is identifiable. I might work up to that, but for now, I will content myself with these few shots.
